## Install

~~All instructions can be found at [draculatheme.com/mobaxterm](https://draculatheme.com/mobaxterm).~~

Open your `MobaXterm.ini` file (normally at `Documents/MobaXterm/MobaXterm.ini`), and replace the `[Colors]` section with the contents of the [file in this repo](./MobaXterm.ini).

This will change the default colour scheme - saved sessions will need to be recreated for it to take effect.
